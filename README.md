This project involves the comprehensive web scraping, cleaning, and exploratory data analysis (EDA) of laptop listings on Flipkart. The goal is to extract actionable business intelligence regarding pricing trends, popular specifications, brand market share, and customer satisfaction in the Indian e-commerce laptop market.

The primary output is the flipkartweb.ipynb Jupyter Notebook, which details the entire workflow from data extraction to visualization and insight generation.

üìä Key Findings & Business Insights
The analysis of 240+ laptop listings revealed critical market dynamics:

The New Baseline Standard: Consumer expectations have shifted. 16 GB RAM (102 listings) and 512 GB SSD are now the most frequently listed specifications, positioning them as the new minimum requirement for general-purpose computing.

The Market Hot Zone: The mid-range segment (laptops priced from ‚Çπ30,000 to ‚Çπ60,000) accounts for the largest share of inventory (127 listings), indicating where inventory and marketing efforts should be concentrated.

Brand Dominance: A duopoly exists, with ASUS (82 listings) and Lenovo (67 listings) controlling over 62% of the analyzed market share.

High-Margin Opportunity: The premium segment (>‚Çπ1,00,000) is sparsely populated (only 4 listings), presenting an untapped opportunity for brands to introduce high-specification, high-margin products.

Customer Satisfaction: The majority of listings are highly rated, with scores clustered tightly between 4.3 and 4.4, suggesting overall product quality is high, and competitive advantages must be sought through service or features (e.g., extended warranties).
